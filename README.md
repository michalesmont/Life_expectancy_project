## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The general purpose of the project assumes finding relations between economic indices of the countries and the life expectancy of citizens. For a better understanding of the foundation of analysis, the main goals were formulated into key questions. 

1. Do the economic indices correspond to the life expectancy?
2. How precisely can we estimate the life expectancy using the model's prediction?
3. How many features should we take under consideration to predict life expectancy?Â¶
4. How does the handling of missing values in a dataset affect the model's response?

Data required for the project: World Bank dataset from 2018 regarding 217 countries (222 rows, 15 columns), including various economic indices (features) and life expectancy values (target).

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a Notebook and 2 additional files available here to summarise the work package related to the questions raised above.  
The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data in the order defined below:

1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Data Modelling
5. Evaluation

The full set of files assigned to the project available in this repository is listed below:

1. WorldBankIndicators.ipynb - A notebook with an exploration of the dataset.
2. README.md - An overview of the repository contents.
3. worldbank.csv - A dataset used for further analysis.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the project can be found in the blog post: https://medium.com/@esmi90/do-you-want-to-live-longer-move-to-hong-kong-83917fd156a9
The article tries to answer the following questions:

1. Do the economic indicators correspond to the life expectancy?
2. Can government expenditures extend your life?
3. Can you mathematically estimate how long you will live?
4. What is the Human Capital Index and how does productivity describe your future?
5. How many aspects should you take under consideration to predict life expectancy?
