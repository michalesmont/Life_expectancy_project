## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I used the World Bank data from 2018 regarding over 200 counties. My goal was to analyze the following issues:

1. Do the economic indicators correspond to the life expectancy?
2. Can government expenditures extend your life?
3. Can you mathematically estimate how long will you live?
4. What is Human Capital Index and how the productivity describes your future?
5. How many aspects should you take under consideration to predict the life expectancy?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 2 notebooks and 2 additional files available here to summarize the work package related to the questions raised above.  
Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data in the order defined below:

1. Data analysis
2. Data cleaning
3. Data exploration
4. Model training and evaluation
    4.1. Full features model 
    4.2. Single feature model
    4.3. Single feature model - different scenario

The full set of files assigned to the project available in this repository is listed below:

1. WorldBankIndicators_part1.ipynb - A notebook with an exploration based on a large dataset filled partially by median values.
2. WorldBankIndicators_part2.ipynb - A notebook with an exploration based on a smaller dataset filled only by initial values.
3. README.md - An overview of the repository contents.
4. worldbank.csv - A dataset used for further analysis.
